## Recap

I mainly put my effort on two things this week. One is ADSP project, which is about Acoustic Echo Cancellation. Another one is the literature survey of image retrieval.

## Acoustic Echo Cancellation

* Look up materials of adaptive filters, including LMS filters, RLS filters, FilteredXLMS filters, etc. Review papers of acoustic echo cancellation.
* Program with MATLAB to implement this function. Design a MATLAB GUI to choose different filter types and display waveform/spectrogram outcomes.
* Write a detailed report of this project and make a PPT with my teammates.

## Literature Survey of Image Retrieval

* After reviewing classical papers and other reserchers' literature survey of image retrieval, I got a whole picture of this field, which could be classified as TBIR, CBIR, SBIR ( CBIR based on advanced features ) . I got familiar with common features, hashing technics, etc. Then I plan to study how to search for a specific object on a large remote sensing image.
* Learn how to use CiteSpace software to get co-citation network to understand a specific research field.
* Gave a one-hour presentation about the literature survey of image retrieval.
