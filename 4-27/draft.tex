\begin{abstract}
	This week I mainly put my effort on making power point slides of CETC 54 and having a meeting on this project.

	\PARstart{A}{fter} reading most classic CNN-based semantic segmentation frameworks, I made a PPT to introduce our research.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Fully convolutional network set up the foundation for CNN-based end-to-end framework. Its main contribution is to replace the fully connected layers with convolutional layers, which makes it possible to train end-to-end CNN-based frameworks with high precision.
		\item Following works including SegNet, DeepLab, PSPNet, etc. In summary, frameworks can be divided into two parts, i.e., encoder and decoder. Encoder part is used to capture semantic information from shallow to deep, which can be viewed as downsampling. Decoder part can acquire accurate location information, which in nature is upsampling.  Fig.~\ref{fig:mp} is the DeepLab V3 architecture. Fig.~\ref{fig:ss} is the DeepLab V3+ Encoder-decoder architecture.
	\end{itemize}

\section{project meeting}
	% LaTeX takes complete care of your document layout ...
	We took part in the project meeting and discussed some details about the applied project.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The major point is data. After the meeting, we know that we need to prepare training data by ourselves. The training data only contains R, G, B channels. Besides, we are supposed to get data with multiple resolutions, and find the best corresponding resolution to classify every object. It will take much effort.
		\item About the software framework, although TensorFlow is more mature on Windows, it's better not limit the framework to TensorFlow. Since Pytorch is much easier to create new frameworks and is preferred in research.
	\end{itemize}
