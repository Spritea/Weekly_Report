	This week I mainly put my effort on treating Prof. Marcello, and taking the machine learning course.

\section{Machine Learning Course}
	% \PARstart{}{} creates a tall first letter for this first paragraph
	\PARstart{T}{his} week we invited Prof. Marcello to give a class of machine learning and big data.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Prof. Marcello is a professor of Computer Science at the University of Venice, Italy. He serves on the editorial boards of IEEE TPAMI. He has initiated several conferences series as Program Chair (EMMCVPR, IWCV, SIMBAD) and served as a General Chair for ICCV 2017 and will serve as a Area Chair for ECCV 2018. He is slao an IEEE Fellow and IAPR Fellow.
		\item This class includes basic concepts of machine learning, such as SVM, VC dimension, clustering. Since he is familiar with graph models and game theory, these parts are more intriguing.
		\item When introduce classes, foreign professors prefer to give us a historical view of these concepts. In this way, students can understand these notions better and can grasp these ideas in an intuitive way.
		\item About communication, since he is not a native speaker, so the speed is not fast. There is no problem of talking with him. Still, I need to enlarge my vocabulary to be more fluent.
	\end{itemize}

	There are some slides that impressed me a lot. Fig.~\ref{fig:mp} is the bias question. Fig.~\ref{fig:ss} is the adversarial sample.
