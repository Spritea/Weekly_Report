\begin{abstract}
	This week I mainly put my effort on testing the images given by contest committee and packing codes to EXE file.

	\PARstart{S}{ince} contest committee gave some training SAR images, I used these images to train models. 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The contest committee gave us 10 SAR building images, whose size is 1,500 $\times$ 1,500.  
		\item At first, I choose 7 images to train, 1 to validate and the last 2 to test. I slice theses images to small ones with size of 512 $\times$ 512 without overlapping. Finally I get 63 training images of 512 $\times$ 512.
		\item The result shows that the F1 score, which is used by the contest, is about 0.5 $\sim$ 0.6. This is on the average.
		
		Fig.~\ref{fig:mp} is the ground truth image. Fig.~\ref{fig:ss} is the predicted image.
	\end{itemize}

\section{Software packing}
	% LaTeX takes complete care of your document layout.
	According to the contest requirement, we need to pack codes to EXE format and run it on Win 7/10 with CUDA 8.0/9.0 platform.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The code of SAR image building extraction uses TensorFlow framework. It supports Windows well and I run the code on Dell laptop with Win 10, CUDA 8 and Python 3.5 correctly.
		\item However, when I try to pack it with Pyinstaller, it reported some mistakes. After some trials, I changed the work directory in the code and it works as expected.
		\item Then I gave Lei Xu the code, and he mailed it to the appointed mailbox on Saturday.
	\end{itemize}
