% some very useful LaTeX packages include:

%\usepackage{cite}      % Written by Donald Arseneau
                        % V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format
                        % of the cite.sty package \cite{} output to follow
                        % that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
                        % result in citation numbers being automatically
                        % sorted and properly "ranged". i.e.,
                        % [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6]
                        % (without using cite.sty)
                        % will become:
                        % [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] (using cite.sty)
                        % cite.sty's \cite will automatically add leading
                        % space, if needed. Use cite.sty's noadjust option
                        % (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this
                        % off. cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
                        % systems. The latest version can be obtained at:

\usepackage{graphicx}   % Written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz
                        % Required if you want graphics, photos, etc.
                        % graphicx.sty is already installed on most LaTeX

%\usepackage{psfrag}    % Written by Craig Barratt, Michael C. Grant,
                        % and David Carlisle
                        % This package allows you to substitute LaTeX
                        % commands for text in imported EPS graphic files.
                        % In this way, LaTeX symbols can be placed into
                        % graphics that have been generated by other
                        % applications. You must use latex->dvips->ps2pdf
                        % workflow (not direct pdf output from pdflatex) if
                        % you wish to use this capability because it works
                        % via some PostScript tricks. Alternatively, the
                        % graphics could be processed as separate files via
                        % psfrag and dvips, then converted to PDF for
                        % inclusion in the main file which uses pdflatex.
                        % Docs are in "The PSfrag System" by Michael C. Grant
                        % and David Carlisle. There is also some information

%\usepackage{stfloats}  % Written by Sigitas Tolusis
                        % Gives LaTeX2e the ability to do double column
                        % floats at the bottom of the page as well as the top.
                        % (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally
                        % possible in LaTeX2e). This is an invasive package
                        % which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e output
                        % routines. It may not work with other packages that
                        % modify the LaTeX2e output routine and/or with other
                        % versions of LaTeX. The latest version and

                        % comments as well as in the presfull.pdf file.
                        % Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as
                        % IEEE does not allow \baselineskip to stretch.
                        % Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
                        % that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
                        % that authors should try to avoid such use.
                        % Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or
                        % midfloat.sty package (by the same author) as IEEE
                        % does not format its papers in such ways.

\usepackage{amsmath}    % From the American Mathematical Society
                        % A popular package that provides many helpful commands
                        % for dealing with mathematics. Note that the AMSmath
                        % package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000 thus
                        % preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline
                        % equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
                        % after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks
                        % as IEEEtran.cls normally does. amsmath.sty is already
                        % installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version

\begin{abstract}
	This week I mainly put my effort on preparing the data set and training DeepLab V2 model with this.
\end{abstract}

% Each section begins with a \section{title} command
\section{Data Set}
	% \PARstart{}{} creates a tall first letter for this first paragraph
	\PARstart{T}{he} original data set the author used is Pascal VOC 2012. So we need to train it on our data set.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item We searched many related papers for proper data set. However, there are no visible spectral remote sensing data set we desired. So I have to build our own data set. 
		\item We tried Google Maps, and attempted to remove text labels and extract 4 targets, including forest, road, building and river. But for Google Maps, I can't separate \textbf{building} from other objects, since there is only one button to control \textbf{man made}, which contains building and other man-made objects. 
		\item \textbf{Solution:} Finally, I found one useful website called \textbf{Mapbox}. It fulfills our requirements perfectly, although it limits the number of images downloaded to 5 per account. The satellite image is Fig.~\ref{fig:sat}, the label image is Fig.~\ref{fig:label}.
	\end{itemize}
 

% Main Part
\section{Training}
	% LaTeX takes complete care of your document layout ...
	After converting data set to the same format with the original one, we started training the model with our data set. During the procedure, we found that on training set, the accuracy can achieve \textbf{80\%}. But on testing set, it's only about \textbf{60\%}, which is really low. We plan to try following measures to improve performance.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Extend data set.} We have $1\,000$ images with size of 350$\times$350 at first. I plan to download more images from \textbf{Mapbox} to train another.
		\item \textbf{Hyperparameters.} Since there is a bunch of parameters, I will try to adjust them to see the result. 
	\end{itemize}

%	The presentation's content is summarized in the report in 4~pages.

	
	% You can cite a book or paper by using \cite{reference}.
	% The references will be defined at the end of this .tex file in the bibliography
%	In particular, Wikipedia is \emph{not} an appropriate 

	% You can reference tables and figure by using the \ref{label} command. Each table and figure needs to have a UNIQUE label.
%	Figures and tables should be labeled and numbered, such as in and Fig.~\ref{fig:tf_plot}.

	% This is how you define a table: the [!hbt] means that LaTeX is forced (by the !) to place the table exactly here (by h), or if that doesnt work because of a pagebreak or so, it tries to place the table to the bottom of the page (by b) or the top (by t).

	% This is how you include a eps figure in your document. LaTeX only accepts EPS or TIFF files.
	\begin{figure}[!hbt]
		% Center the figure.
		\begin{center}
		% Include the eps file, scale it such that it's width equals the column width. You can also put width=8cm for example...
%		\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{LAB01-00002}
		\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{SAT01-00000}
		% Create a subtitle for the figure.
		\caption{Satellite image}
		% Define the label of the figure. It's good to use 'fig:title', so you know that the label belongs to a figure.
		\label{fig:sat}
		\end{center}
	\end{figure}

	\begin{figure}[!hbt]
	% Center the figure.
	\vspace{-1cm}
		\begin{center}
		% Include the eps file, scale it such that it's width equals the column width. You can also put width=8cm for example...
		%		\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{LAB01-00002}
		\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{LAB01-00000}
		% Create a subtitle for the figure.
		\caption{Label image}
		% Define the label of the figure. It's good to use 'fig:title', so you know that the label belongs to a figure.
